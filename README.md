## ProjectConfigs

### Proof of concept for storing plugin configurations in separate projects

### Instructions
1. Run CreateConfiguration with a project name to have credentials and configurations stored there
1. If project name not provided, crendials and configuration will be created as usual
1. Run "Use Credentials" with a project name to show that it is working

Note: config/credential names in a project have to be unique across all plugins because credentials are root level objects
